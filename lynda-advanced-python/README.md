## Notes

### Strings vs. bytes

**String:** sequence of unicode characters.  

**Bytes:** sequece of raw 8bit values.

### Template strings (String formatting)

**String doc:** [for python3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html) 

[Template class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings) from string can be used for string formatting.

For simple variable substitution this is easier to use and more readable.

Templates could be supplied from a source that I can't controll or I don't fully trust.

### Built-in fnctions

Find more info about built-in functions [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).

Use built-in functions as often as possible. This leverage the optimized existing code in Python.

### Iterators

Built-in methods to help out with sequence looping.
